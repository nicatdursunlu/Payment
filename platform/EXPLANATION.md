# IBA Tech Alumni Code Challenge

I use React Navigation(Stack) for transition between two screens, redux and redux-persist
(AsnycStorage) for getting and storing users data(If you lost internet connection you 
will be able to see users data on your local device). For showing indicators I use 
special library react-native-circular-progress(Because it is easy to manage percentage, 
filled color, unfilled color). For icons I use library react-native-vector-icons, inside 
we have several icon packages. In commons folder I create Commons.js file. It is 
container that is wrap the whole screens for common options. I try to split code
(use components in each screen folder) to be more clear, readable and understandable. 
Styles are not exctly the same. I focused on general structure of app. During the code 
challenge, several times I lost my internet connection and time, but I try to do my best. 
I fix some bags after submitting you can see them (I do not know it causes some 
troubles or no, but I did it).
