# IBA Tech Alumni Code Challenge

I use React Navigation(Stack) for transition between two screens, redux and redux-persist
(AsnycStorage) for getting and storing users data(If you lost internet connection you will 
be able to see users data on your local device). For showing indicators I use special 
library react-native-circular-progress(Because it is easy to manage percentage, filled 
color, unfilled color). For icons I use library react-native-vector-icons, inside we 
have several icon packages. Styles are not exctly the same. I focused on general
structure of app. During the code challenge, several times I use my internet connection 
and lost time, but I try to do my best. I fix some bags after submitting you can 
see them (I do not know it causes some troubles or no, but I did it)
